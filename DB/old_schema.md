| `username`     | TEXT            | UNIQUE NOT NULL                      | The username chosen by the user, must be unique and cannot be null.        |
| `password_hash`| TEXT            | NOT NULL                             | The hashed password for secure storage, cannot be null.                    |
| `email`        | TEXT            | (None)                               | An optional email address for the user; can be null.                       |
| `created_at`   | TIMESTAMP       | DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP            | The date and time when the user account was created, defaults to now.      |

**Key Features**:
- The `user_id` is the primary key, ensuring each user has a unique identifier.
- The `username` is unique to prevent duplicate accounts with the same name.
- The `password_hash` stores a hashed version of the password (using `pbkdf2_sha256` from the `auth.py` file) for security.
- The `email` field is optional, allowing users to sign up without providing it.

| `created_at`   | TIMESTAMP       | DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP            | The date and time when the project was created, defaults to now.           |

**Key Features**:
- The `project_id` is the primary key.
- The `user_id` is a foreign key linking to the `users` table, ensuring every project belongs to a user.
- A unique constraint exists on the combination of `user_id` and `project_name`, preventing a user from creating multiple projects with the same name.

**Relationships**:
- One user (from `users`) can have many projects (one-to-many).

**Key Features**:
- The `id` is the primary key.
- The `project_id` is a foreign key linking to the `projects` table, ensuring each QA pair belongs to a project.
- The `call_id` is a foreign key linking to the `calls` table but is optional (can be null), allowing QA pairs to be stored independently of calls.
- `question` and `answer` are technically nullable in the schema, but application logic (e.g., in `store_qa_pair`) enforces that they are provided.

**Relationships**:
- One project (from `projects`) can have many QA pairs (one-to-many).
- One call (from `calls`) can have many QA pairs (one-to-many), but this link is optional.

### **Schema Overview and Relationships**
Hereâ€™s a summary of how the tables connect:
- **`users`** â†’ **`projects`**: A user can create multiple projects (one-to-many via `user_id`).
- **`projects`** â†’ **`documents`**, **`calls`**, **`utterances`**, **`qa_pairs`**, **`datasets`**: Each project can have multiple associated documents, calls, utterances, QA pairs, and datasets (one-to-many via `project_id`).
- **`calls`** â†’ **`utterances`**, **`qa_pairs`**: A call can have multiple utterances and QA pairs (one-to-many via `call_id`), though the `call_id` in `qa_pairs` is optional.

**Foreign Key Enforcement**:
- The `get_db_connection()` function in `db.py` enables `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`, ensuring that SQLite enforces these relationships (e.g., you canâ€™t delete a user if they have projects).

**Redundancy Note**:
- The `project_id` in the `utterances` table is somewhat redundant since `call_id` already links to `calls`, which links to `projects`. This might be intentional for query optimization or flexibility.
